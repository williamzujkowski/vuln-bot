  "title": "Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid <= 0.9.112 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload via wpvivid_upload_file",
  "description": "The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.112. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.",
