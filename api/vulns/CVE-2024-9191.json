  "description": "The Okta Device Access features, provided by the Okta Verify agent for Windows, provides access to the OktaDeviceAccessPipe, which enables attackers in a compromised device to retrieve passwords associated with Desktop MFA passwordless logins. The vulnerability was discovered via routine penetration testing.\n\nNote: A precondition of this vulnerability is that the user must be using the Okta Device Access passwordless feature. Okta Device Access users not using passwordless are not affected, and customers only using Okta Verify on platforms other than Windows, or only using FastPass are not affected.",
