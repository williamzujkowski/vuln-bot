  "title": "Cisco IOS XR Software Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability",
  "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) processing in the egress direction of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because certain packets are handled incorrectly when they are received on an ingress interface on one line card and destined out of an egress interface on another line card where the egress ACL is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an egress ACL on the affected device.\r\nFor more information about this vulnerability, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
