  "title": "Junos OS: MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E: Memory leak will be observed when subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface",
  "description": "A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. \n\nThis issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.\n\nThe Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:\n  > show system processes extensive\n\nThe following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor\n  > show system info | match sensord\n   PID   NAME                 MEMORY     PEAK MEMORY    %CPU   THREAD-COUNT CORE-AFFINITY   UPTIME\n\n   1986  sensord            877.57MB   877.57MB         2       4           0,2-15          7-21:41:32\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  from 21.2R3-S5 before 21.2R3-S7, \n  *  from 21.4R3-S4 before 21.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.2R3 before 22.2R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.3R2 before 22.3R3-S2, \n  *  from 22.4R1 before 22.4R3, \n  *  from 23.2R1 before 23.2R2.",
