  "title": "Smart Forms <= 2.6.98 - Authenticated (Admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
  "description": "The Smart Forms – when you need more than just a contact form plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.98 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
