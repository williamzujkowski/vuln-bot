  "title": "Mixed Dynamic RFC Destination vulnerability through Remote Function Call (RFC) in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP",
  "description": "In certain conditions, SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows an authenticated attacker to craft a Remote Function Call (RFC) request to restricted destinations, which can be used to expose credentials for a remote service. These credentials can then be further exploited to completely compromise the remote service, potentially resulting in a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.",
