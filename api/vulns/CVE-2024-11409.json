  "title": "Grid View Gallery <= 1.0 - Authenticated (Editor+) PHP Object Injection",
  "description": "The Grid View Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.0 via deserialization of untrusted input from cs_all_photos_details parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
