  "title": "Authenticated Remote Command Injection in Delta Electronics DVW",
  "description": "The Delta Electronics DVW-W02W2-E2 devices expose a web administration interface to users. This interface implements multiple features that are affected by command injections and stack overflows vulnerabilities.\nSuccessful exploitation of these flaws would allow remote unauthenticated attackers to gain remote code execution withÂ elevated privileges on the affected devices.\n\nThis issue affects DVW-W02W2-E2 through version 2.5.2.\n\n",
