  "description": "The Giveaways and Contests by RafflePress – Get More Website Traffic, Email Subscribers, and Social Followers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘parent_url’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
