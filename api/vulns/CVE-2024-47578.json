  "title": "Multiple vulnerabilities in SAP NetWeaver AS for JAVA(Adobe Document Services)",
  "description": "Adobe Document Service allows an attacker with administrator privileges to send a crafted request from a vulnerable web application. It is usually used to target internal systems behind firewalls that are normally inaccessible to an attacker from the external network, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. On successful exploitation, the attacker can read or modify any file and/or make the entire system unavailable.",
