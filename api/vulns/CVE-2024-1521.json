  "description": "The Elementor Website Builder Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via an SVGZ file uploaded via the Form widget in all versions up to, and including, 3.20.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable on web servers running NGINX. It is not exploitable on web servers running Apache HTTP Server.",
