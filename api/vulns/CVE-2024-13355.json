  "title": "Admin and Customer Messages After Order for WooCommerce <= 13.2 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Limited File Upload to Cross-Site Scripting",
  "description": "The Admin and Customer Messages After Order for WooCommerce: OrderConvo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to limited file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the upload_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 13.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible and is confirmed to make Cross-Site Scripting possible.",
