  "title": "XSS in @urql/next",
  "description": "urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.  The `@urql/next` package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit this an attacker would need to ensure that the response returns `html` tags and that the web-application is using streamed responses (non-RSC). This vulnerability is due to improper escaping of html-like characters in the response-stream. To fix this vulnerability upgrade to version 1.1.1",
