  "description": "The WPBakery Visual Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘link’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, and with post permissions granted by an Administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
