  "title": "Basic Auth Credential Leakage to Logs After Fetch Registry Error in Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka with Peer Awareness",
  "description": "Steeltoe is an open source project that provides a collection of libraries that helps users build production-grade cloud-native applications using externalized configuration, service discovery, distributed tracing, application management, and more. When utilizing multiple Eureka server service URLs with basic auth and encountering an issue with fetching the service registry, an error is logged with the Eureka server service URLs but only the first URL is masked. The code in question is  `_logger.LogError(e, \"FetchRegistry Failed for Eureka service urls: {EurekaServerServiceUrls}\", new Uri(ClientConfig.EurekaServerServiceUrls).ToMaskedString());` in the `DiscoveryClient.cs` file which may leak credentials into logs. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 of the Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka nuget package.",
