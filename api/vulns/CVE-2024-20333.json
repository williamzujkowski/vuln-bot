  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change specific data within the interface on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change a specific field within the web-based management interface, even though they should not have access to change that field.",
