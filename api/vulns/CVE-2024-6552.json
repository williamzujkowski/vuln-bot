  "title": "Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia <= 1.2 - Unauthenticated Full Path Disclosure",
  "description": "The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors on within test files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.",
