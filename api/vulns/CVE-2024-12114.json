  "title": "FooGallery – Responsive Photo Gallery, Image Viewer, Justified, Masonry & Carousel <= 2.4.29 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Custom+) Arbitrary Post/Page Updates",
  "description": "The FooGallery – Responsive Photo Gallery, Image Viewer, Justified, Masonry & Carousel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.29 via the foogallery_attachment_modal_save AJAX action due to missing validation on a user controlled key (img_id). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with granted access and above, to update arbitrary post and page content. This requires the Gallery Creator Role setting to be a value lower than 'Editor' for there to be any real impact.",
