  "title": "Weak Passwords Requirements in goTenna Pro",
  "description": "The goTenna Pro App uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via\n the key broadcast method. If the broadcasted encryption key is captured\n over RF, and password is cracked via brute force attack, it is possible\n to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent \nvia encrypted broadcast with that particular key. This only applies when\n the key is broadcasted over RF. This is an optional feature, so it is \nrecommended to use local QR encryption key sharing for additional \nsecurity on this and previous versions.",
