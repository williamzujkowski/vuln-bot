  "title": "Community by PeepSo <= 6.4.6.1 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
  "description": "The Community by PeepSo – Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles, Premium – Mobile App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via URLs in posts, comments, and profiles when Markdown support is enabled in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
