  "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the Alta Recovery Vault feature of Veritas NetBackup before 10.4 and NetBackup Appliance before 5.4.

This vulnerability allowed a NetBackup administrator to modify the expiration of backups under Governance mode (which could cause premature deletion).",
