  "title": "Evmos vulnerable to exploit of smart contract account and vesting",
  "description": "Evmos is a decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine chain on the Cosmos Network. Prior to version 19.0.0, a user can create a vesting account with a 3rd party account (EOA or contract) as funder. Then, this user can create an authorization for the contract.CallerAddress, this is the authorization checked in the code. But the funds are taken from the funder address provided in the message. Consequently, the user can fund a vesting account with a 3rd party account without its permission. The funder address can be any address, so this vulnerability can be used to drain all the accounts in the chain. The issue has been patched in version 19.0.0.",
