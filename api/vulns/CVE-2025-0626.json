  "cveId": "CVE-2025-0626",
  "title": "Hidden Functionality vulnerability in Contec Health CMS8000 Patient Monitor",
  "description": "The \"monitor\" binary in the firmware of the affected product attempts to mount to a hard-coded, routable IP address, bypassing existing device network settings to do so. The function also enables the network interface of the device if it is disabled. The function is triggered by attempting to update the device from the user menu. This could serve as a backdoor to the device, and could lead to a malicious actor being able to upload and overwrite files on the device.",
