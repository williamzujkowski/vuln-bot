  "title": "API Key Leak in lobe-chat",
  "description": "Lobe Chat is an open-source LLMs/AI chat framework. In affected versions if an attacker can successfully authenticate through SSO/Access Code, they can obtain the real backend API Key by modifying the base URL to their own attack URL on the frontend and setting up a server-side request. This issue has been addressed in version 0.162.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
