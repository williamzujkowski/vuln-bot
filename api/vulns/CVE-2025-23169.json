  "description": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform allows customization of the user interface, including the header, footer, and logo. However, the input provided for these customizations is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing a malicious user to inject and store cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads. \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.",
