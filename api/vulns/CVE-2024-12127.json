  "description": "The Learning Management System, eLearning, Course Builder, WordPress LMS Plugin – Sikshya LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘page’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 0.0.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
