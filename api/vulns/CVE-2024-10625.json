  "cveId": "CVE-2024-10625",
  "title": "WooCommerce Support Ticket System <= 17.7 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion",
  "description": "The WooCommerce Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_tmp_uploaded_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 17.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).",
