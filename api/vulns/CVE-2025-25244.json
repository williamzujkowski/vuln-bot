  "title": "Missing Authorization Check in SAP Business Warehouse (Process Chains)",
  "description": "SAP Business Warehouse (Process Chains) allows an attacker to manipulate the process execution due to missing authorization check. An attacker with display authorization for the process chain object could set one or all processes to be skipped. This means corresponding activities, such as data loading, activation, or deletion, will not be executed as initially modeled. This could lead to unexpected results in business reporting leading to a significant impact on integrity. However, there is no impact on confidentiality or availability.",
