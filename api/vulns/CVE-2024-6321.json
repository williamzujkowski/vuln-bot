  "title": "ScrollTo Bottom <= 1.1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload",
  "description": "The ScrollTo Bottom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'options_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
