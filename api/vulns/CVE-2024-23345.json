  "description": "Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application.  All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.10 or 2.1.2 are potentially impacted by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to inadequate input sanitization, any user-editable fields that support Markdown rendering, including are potentially susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via maliciously crafted data. This issue is fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.10 and 2.1.2.",
