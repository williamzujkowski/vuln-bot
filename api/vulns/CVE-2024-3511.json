  "title": "Incorrect Authorization in Multiple WSO2 Products Allows Unauthorized Access to Registry Versioned Files",
  "description": "An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products that allows unauthorized access to versioned files stored in the registry. Due to flawed authorization logic, a malicious actor with access to the management console can exploit a specific bypass method to retrieve versioned files without proper authorization.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized disclosure of configuration or resource files that may be stored as registry versions, potentially aiding further attacks or system reconnaissance.",
