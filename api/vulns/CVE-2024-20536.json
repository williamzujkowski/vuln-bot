  "title": "Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller SQL Injection Vulnerability",
  "description": "A vulnerability in a REST API endpoint and web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-only privileges to execute arbitrary SQL commands on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a specific REST API endpoint or web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data on an internal database, which could affect the availability of the device.&nbsp;",
