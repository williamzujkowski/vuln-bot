  "description": "Hush Line is an open-source whistleblower management system. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.3.5, the productions server appeared to have been misconfigured and missed providing any content security policy or security headers. This could result in bypassing of cross-site scripting filters. Version 0.3.5 fixed the issue.",
