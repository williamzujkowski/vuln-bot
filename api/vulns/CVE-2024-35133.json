  "description": "IBM Security Verify Access 10.0.0 through 10.0.8 OIDC Provider could allow a remote authenticated attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted.
