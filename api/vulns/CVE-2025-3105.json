  "title": "Vehica Core <= 1.0.97 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation",
  "description": "The Vehica Core plugin for WordPress, used by the Vehica - Car Dealer & Listing WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.97. This is due to the plugin not properly validating user meta fields prior to updating them in the database. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change escalate their privileges to Administrator.",
