  "title": "XWiki programming rights may be inherited by inclusion ",
  "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The content of a document included using `{{include reference=\"targetdocument\"/}}` is executed with the right of the includer and not with the right of its author. This means that any user able to modify the target document can impersonate the author of the content which used the `include` macro. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0 RC1 by making the default behavior safe.\n",
