  "description": "An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. A Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the email-subject field exists while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configurations. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing the XSS payload in the email-subject. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim clicks on the email-subject value, it triggers the XSS payload.",
