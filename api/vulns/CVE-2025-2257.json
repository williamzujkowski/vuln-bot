  "description": "The Total Upkeep – WordPress Backup Plugin plus Restore & Migrate by BoldGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.16.10 via the compression_level setting. This is due to the plugin using the compression_level setting in proc_open() without any validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.",
