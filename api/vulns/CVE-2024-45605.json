  "title": "Improper authorization on deletion of user issue alert notifications in sentry",
  "description": "Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. An authenticated user delete the user issue alert notifications for arbitrary users given a know alert ID. A patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to delete user alert notifications. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. Self-Hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 24.9.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
