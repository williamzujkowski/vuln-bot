  "description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) function of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected device from processing any control plane UDP packets.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the affected device from processing any control plane UDP packets, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
