  "title": "School Management System – WPSchoolPress <= 2.2.10 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Teacher+) Account Takeover/Privilege Escalation",
  "description": "The School Management System – WPSchoolPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.10. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.",
