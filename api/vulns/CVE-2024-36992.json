  "description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.2.2, 9.1.5, and 9.0.10 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.1.2312.200 and 9.1.2308.207, a low-privileged user that does not hold the admin or power Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through a View that could result in execution of unauthorized JavaScript code in the browser of a user. The “url” parameter of the Dashboard element does not have proper input validation to reject invalid URLs, which could lead to a Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) exploit.",
