  "description": "The WCFM – Frontend Manager for WooCommerce along with Bookings Subscription Listings Compatible plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 6.7.12 via the WCFM_Customers_Manage_Controller::processing function due to missing validation on the ID user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber/customer-level access and above, to change the email address of administrator user accounts which allows them to reset the password and access the administrator account.",
