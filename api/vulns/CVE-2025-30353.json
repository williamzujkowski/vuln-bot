  "title": "Directus's webhook trigger flows can leak sensitive data",
  "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.5.0, when a Flow with the \"Webhook\" trigger and the \"Data of Last Operation\" response body encounters a ValidationError thrown by a failed condition operation, the API response includes sensitive data. This includes environmental variables, sensitive API keys, user accountability information, and operational data. This issue poses a significant security risk, as any unintended exposure of this data could lead to potential misuse. Version 11.5.0 fixes the issue.",
