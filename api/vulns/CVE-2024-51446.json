  "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion V2310 (All versions), Polarion V2404 (All versions < V2404.4). The file upload feature of the affected application improperly sanitizes xml files. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting attack by uploading specially crafted xml files that are later downloaded and viewed by other users of the application.",
