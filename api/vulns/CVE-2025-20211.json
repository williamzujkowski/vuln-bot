  "title": "Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform Software Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability",
  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
