  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms for specific file management functions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to a location that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Read-Only Administrator&nbsp;credentials.",
