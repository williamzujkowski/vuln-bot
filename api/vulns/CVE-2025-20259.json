  "title": "Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent for Windows Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability",
  "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the update process of Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to delete arbitrary files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on files that are in the local file system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using a symbolic link to perform an agent upgrade that redirects the delete operation of any protected file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file system of the affected device.",
