  "title": "Junos OS: SRX Series: On devices with Anti-Virus enabled, malicious server responses will cause memory to leak ultimately causing forwarding to stop",
  "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series \n\nallows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nOn all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.\n\nA jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:\n\n(<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!\n\nTo recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: \n\n  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,\n  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3,\n  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2.",
