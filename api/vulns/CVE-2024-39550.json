  "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the rtlogd process of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3 allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger internal events cause ( which can be done by repeated port flaps) to cause a slow memory leak, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). \n\nMemory can only be recovered by manually restarting rtlogd process. \nThe memory usage can be monitored using the below command.\n\n    user@host> show system processes extensive | match rtlog \n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3 line card: \n\n\n\n  *  from 21.2R3 before 21.2R3-S8, \n  *  from 21.4R2 before 21.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S2, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S1, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.",
