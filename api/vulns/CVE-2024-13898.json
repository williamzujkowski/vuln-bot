  "title": "Simple Banner <= 3.0.4 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
  "description": "The Simple Banner – Easily add multiple Banners/Bars/Notifications/Announcements to the top or bottom of your website plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
