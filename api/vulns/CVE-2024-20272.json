  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected system and execute commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication in a specific API and improper validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading arbitrary files to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the system, execute arbitrary commands on the operating system, and elevate privileges to root.",
