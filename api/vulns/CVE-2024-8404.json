  "title": "Arbitrary File Deletion in PaperCut NG/MF Web Print Hot folder",
  "description": "An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. \n\nImportant: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nUpdate:\n\nThis CVE has been updated in May 2025 to update the fixed version and fix process. Please refer to the May 2025 Security Bulletin.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037.",
