  "title": "Electrolink FM/DAB/TV Transmitter Missing Authentication for Critical Function",
  "description": "The devices allow access to an unprotected endpoint that allows MPFS \nfile system binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2 file \nsystem module provides a light-weight read-only file system that can be \nstored in external EEPROM, external serial flash, or internal flash \nprogram memory. This file system serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web \nserver module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is available to \nother applications that require basic read-only storage capabilities. \nThis can be exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds \nthe web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.",
