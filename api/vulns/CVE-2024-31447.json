  "title": "Shopware has Improper Session Handling in store-api",
  "description": "Shopware 6 is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. Starting in version 6.3.5.0 and prior to versions 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8, when a authenticated request is made to `POST /store-api/account/logout`, the cart will be cleared, but the User won't be logged out. This affects only the direct store-api usage, as the PHP Storefront listens additionally on `CustomerLogoutEvent` and invalidates the session additionally. The problem has been fixed in Shopware 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8. Those who are unable to update can install the latest version of the Shopware Security Plugin as a workaround.\n",
