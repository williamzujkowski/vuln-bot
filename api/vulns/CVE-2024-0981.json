  "description": "Okta Browser Plugin versions 6.5.0 through 6.31.0 (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari) are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This issue occurs when the plugin prompts the user to save these credentials within Okta Personal. A fix was implemented to properly escape these fields, addressing the vulnerability. Importantly, if Okta Personal is not added to the plugin to enable multi-account view, the Workforce Identity Cloud plugin is not affected by this issue. The vulnerability is fixed in Okta Browser Plugin version 6.32.0 for Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox.",
