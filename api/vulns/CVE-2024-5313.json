  "description": "CWE-668: Exposure of the Resource Wrong Sphere vulnerability exists that exposes a SSH\ninterface over the product network interface. This does not allow to directly exploit the product or\nmake any unintended operation as the SSH interface access is protected by an authentication\nmechanism. Impacts are limited to port scanning and fingerprinting activities as well as attempts\nto perform a potential denial of service attack on the exposed SSH interface.",
