  "description": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides functionality to upload various types of files. However, the Java code handling file uploads contains an argument injection vulnerability. By appending additional arguments to the file name, an attacker can bypass MIME type validation, allowing the upload of arbitrary file types. This flaw can be exploited to place a malicious file on disk. \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.",
