  "title": "Chative Live chat and Chatbot <= 1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery via add_chative_widget_action Function",
  "description": "The Chative Live chat and Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the add_chative_widget_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the channel ID or organization ID via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This could lead to redirecting the live chat widget to an attacker-controlled channel.",
