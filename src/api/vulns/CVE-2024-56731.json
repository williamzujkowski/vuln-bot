  "description": "Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Prior to version 0.13.3, it's still possible to delete files under the .git directory and achieve remote command execution due to an insufficient patch for CVE-2024-39931. Unprivileged user accounts can execute arbitrary commands on the Gogs instance with the privileges of the account specified by RUN_USER in the configuration. Allowing attackers to access and alter any users' code hosted on the same instance. This issue has been patched in version 0.13.3.",
