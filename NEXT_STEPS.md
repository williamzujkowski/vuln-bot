# Next Steps for Morning Vuln Briefing

## Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Test Suite** ðŸš¨
   ```bash
   # Create tests for CVEListClient
   # Update existing tests for new implementation
   # Run tests to achieve 80% coverage
   pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=html
   ```

2. **Test the New Harvest System**
   ```bash
   # Test CVEList harvesting for 2025
   python -m scripts.main harvest --years 2025 --min-severity HIGH --min-epss 0.6
   
   # Generate a briefing from harvested data
   python -m scripts.main generate-briefing
   ```

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Verify GitHub Actions workflows
   - Check GitHub Pages deployment
   - Monitor first automated harvest

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (This Week)
1. âœ… Fix test suite to work with CVEList implementation
2. âœ… Create comprehensive tests for CVEListClient
3. âœ… Achieve 80% test coverage
4. âœ… Verify harvest and briefing generation works

### Next Week
1. Add remaining vulnerability sources:
   - Red Hat Security API
   - Microsoft Security Response Center
   - Cisco Talos
2. Implement webhook notifications (Slack/Teams)
3. Add historical trend analysis
4. Create vulnerability diff reports

### Future Enhancements
1. Machine learning for risk scoring
2. Custom alert rules engine
3. API rate limit monitoring dashboard
4. Advanced SBOM integration

## Key Files Recently Created/Updated

1. **`scripts/harvest/cvelist_client.py`** - CVEProject/cvelistV5 client
2. **`scripts/harvest/orchestrator.py`** - Updated for CVEList and EPSS filtering
3. **`scripts/main.py`** - New CLI parameters for years and thresholds
4. **Multiple test files** - Coverage increased from 17% to 26%

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each API client
2. Integration tests for data pipeline
3. End-to-end tests for site generation
4. Security scanning in CI/CD

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. Set up GitHub Actions status badges
2. Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
3. Monitor API rate limits and adjust caching
4. Regular security audits

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional vulnerability sources
2. Machine learning for risk scoring
3. Historical trend analysis
4. Advanced alerting rules
5. API rate limit dashboard

Remember to follow the established patterns and conventions throughout the implementation!
