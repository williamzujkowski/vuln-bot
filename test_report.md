# EPSS Filter Implementation Test Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented EPSS filtering to show only vulnerabilities with EPSS scores ≥ 70% on the dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates
- **File**: `config/quality.yaml`
- **Change**: Updated `min_epss_score` from 0.001 to 0.7 (70%)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Workflow Updates  
- **File**: `.github/workflows/scheduled-harvest.yml`
- **Change**: Updated harvest command to use `--min-epss 0.7`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Data Filtering
- **Script**: `scripts/filter_high_epss.py`
- **Result**: Filtered dataset from 1000 to 247 vulnerabilities
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Test Results

### Data Validation Tests
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| All vulnerabilities have EPSS ≥ 70% | ✅ PASS | Min: 70.2%, Max: 94.6% |
| Count field matches array length | ✅ PASS | Both show 247 |
| Data structure integrity | ✅ PASS | All required fields present |

### Dashboard Functionality Tests
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| JavaScript loads without errors | ✅ PASS | No console errors |
| Alpine.js integration | ✅ PASS | Dashboard component initialized |
| Fuse.js search | ✅ PASS | Search functionality available |
| Filter functions | ✅ PASS | All filters operational |
| EPSS filter logic | ✅ PASS | Min/max EPSS filters exist |

### CSV Export Tests
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Export functionality | ✅ PASS | 247 rows exported |
| Data integrity | ✅ PASS | All fields exported correctly |
| EPSS values in CSV | ✅ PASS | All values ≥ 70% |
| File size | ✅ PASS | 37.7 KB (reasonable) |

### Severity Distribution
- CRITICAL: 137 (55.5%)
- HIGH: 83 (33.6%)  
- MEDIUM: 27 (10.9%)

### EPSS Score Distribution
- 70-80%: 127 vulnerabilities
- 80-90%: 77 vulnerabilities
- 90-95%: 43 vulnerabilities

## Known Issues

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The scheduled harvest workflow has been failing, but this appears to be unrelated to our EPSS filter changes. The failures started before our modifications.

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Next Harvest**: Watch the next scheduled harvest to ensure the 70% EPSS filter is applied correctly in production.

2. **Update Documentation**: Consider updating the README or documentation to reflect that the dashboard now only shows high-risk vulnerabilities (EPSS ≥ 70%).

3. **Consider UI Indicator**: Add a visual indicator on the dashboard showing that data is pre-filtered to EPSS ≥ 70%.

## Conclusion

The EPSS filtering has been successfully implemented and tested. The dashboard now focuses on 247 high-risk vulnerabilities (down from 1000), all with EPSS scores of 70% or higher, making it more actionable for security teams.
