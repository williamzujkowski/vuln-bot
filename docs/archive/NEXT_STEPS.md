# Next Steps for Morning Vuln Briefing

## Immediate Actions

1. **Monitor Production Deployment** ‚úÖ
   - Site is live at https://williamzujkowski.github.io/vuln-bot/
   - GitHub Actions workflows are configured and running
   - Pages deployment is automated after CI passes
   - Monitor nightly harvest at 2 AM UTC

2. **Increase Test Coverage** üö®
   ```bash
   # Current coverage: 64% ‚Üí Target: 80%
   # Focus on modules with lower coverage
   pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=html
   ```

3. **Remove Temporary Limits**
   - CVEListClient currently limited to 5 directories and 10 files
   - Remove these limits for production harvesting
   - Test with full dataset

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ‚è≥ Increase test coverage from 64% to 80%
2. ‚è≥ Remove temporary limits in CVEListClient
3. ‚è≥ Test full-scale harvest with production data
4. ‚è≥ Monitor nightly harvest runs

### Next Week
1. Add remaining vulnerability sources:
   - Red Hat Security API
   - Microsoft Security Response Center
   - Cisco Talos
2. Implement webhook notifications (Slack/Teams)
3. Add historical trend analysis
4. Create vulnerability diff reports

### Future Enhancements
1. Machine learning for risk scoring
2. Custom alert rules engine
3. API rate limit monitoring dashboard
4. Advanced SBOM integration

## Key Files Recently Created/Updated

1. **`scripts/harvest/cvelist_client.py`** - CVEProject/cvelistV5 client
2. **`scripts/harvest/orchestrator.py`** - Updated for CVEList and EPSS filtering
3. **`scripts/main.py`** - New CLI parameters for years and thresholds
4. **`.github/workflows/pages.yml`** - GitHub Pages deployment workflow
5. **`src/assets/js/dashboard.js`** - Fixed API paths and state management
6. **Multiple test files** - Coverage increased to 64%, all tests passing

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each API client
2. Integration tests for data pipeline
3. End-to-end tests for site generation
4. Security scanning in CI/CD

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. Set up GitHub Actions status badges
2. Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
3. Monitor API rate limits and adjust caching
4. Regular security audits

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional vulnerability sources
2. Machine learning for risk scoring
3. Historical trend analysis
4. Advanced alerting rules
5. API rate limit dashboard

Remember to follow the established patterns and conventions throughout the implementation!
